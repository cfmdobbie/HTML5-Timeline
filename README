HTML5-Timeline

A simple HTML5 app designed by Charlie Dobbie in Feb 2016, and released under
the MIT licence.

This was developed as a very simple test of interpreting JSON data input via a
form, and using it to generate SVG directly on the page.  Other functionality of
note is extraction of SVG source and displaying via an HTML5 details/summary tag
pair.

Some example JSON data is as follows:

    {
      "lineColor": "black",
      "textColor": "blue",
      "start": "1990",
      "end": "2020",
      "events": [
        {"date": "9 June 1993", "name": "Jurassic Park"},
        {"date": "23 May 1997", "name": "The Lost World"},
        {"date": "18 July 2001", "name": "Jurassic Park III"},
        {"date": "12 June 2015", "name": "Jurassic World"}
      ]
    }

Dates are interpreted via the built-in Date.parse() function, so can be provided
in a range of different formats, depending on brower support.  The way the date
calculations work, you can reverse the timeline simply by switching start and
end dates, and the events will be positioned correctly.  No attempt is currently
made to ensure all text remains entirely on the screen.

This was a one-off test, so is not intended to be developed further.  However,
if further development were performed, the following would be of value:

* Error handling on receipt of malformed JSON
* Error handling on invalid data types
* Process SVG source to remove DOM id and add correct standalone namespace
* Dynamic sizing to ensure text doesn't overlap or run off the edge
* Better positioning of dates (extra fudged vertical offset due to baseline position
* Pretty date formatting
* Optional supression of cap date labels
* Simple title
* Automatically refresh SVG diagram as data is edited
* Pretty output of SVG source
* Direct download link for SVG diagram
